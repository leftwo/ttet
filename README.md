# Tetris clone

An almost functional tetris clone.

Current Keys:
```
   w     Move left
   d     Move right
   w     Rotate
   s     Move down
(space)  Hard drop
```

The plan is to roll this into a typing tutor where the keys will change
with each new tetromino

Written to learn some rust and eventually make it into a typing program.
It is using the ggez game engine, but I now believe that engine is probably
overkill for what I need here.  I'm also pretty sure I'm not using it
correctly.
